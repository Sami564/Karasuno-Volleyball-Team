                        Daichi Sawamura (澤村 大地, Sawamura Daichi) is the captain of the volleyball team and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. A wing spiker and dependable receiver, he functions as one of the team's defensive pillars. He is a resilient and kind leader who encourages the team both on and off the court. Though Daichi is usually friendly and approachable, he occasionally adopts a "scary" demeanor when disciplining his team, terrifying his teammates. He is close friends with Kōshi Sugawara and Asahi Azumane, having joined the volleyball team with them as first-years.

                        Shoyo Hinata (日向 翔陽, Hinata Shōyō) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and the primary protagonist of the series. Despite his short stature, he is inspired to play volleyball at Karasuno after witnessing a player of similarly short height lead the Karasuno team to a national tournament. After an unsuccessful stint in middle school, Hinata joins the Karasuno team, where he butts heads with fellow first-year setter Tobio Kageyama. Though lacking in technique and general game knowledge, Hinata's speed and vertical jump allow him to act as a decoy to mislead opposing teams, earning him a position on the starting lineup as a middle blocker.

                        Tobio Kageyama (影山 飛雄, Kageyama Tobio) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. Though an exceptionally diligent and strategic setter, his ruthless desire to win and authoritarian-style leadership put him at odds with his volleyball teammates in middle school, earning him the pejorative nickname "King of the Court." Despite his hostile relationship with Shoyo Hinata, the two form an unusual setter-spiker partnership that earns them notability within their prefecture. Regarded by others as a "volleyball genius," Kageyama is famous for his pinpoint accuracy when setting, as well as his ability to bring utilize his spikers to their maximum potential. Off the court, Kageyama is typically polite and has good intentions, but has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself.

                        Yū Nishinoya (西谷 夕, Nishinoya Yū) is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and the team's libero and defensive specialist. Along with Tobio Kageyama, he is considered one of Karasuno's two prodigies, having won the prefecture's award for "Best Libero" during junior high. The shortest player on the team, Nishinoya is loud, energetic, and deeply passionate about his position as libero. He is often seen with Ryūnosuke Tanaka, both of whom are regularly disciplined for their antics.

He is loud, fierce and aggressive, but deeply respects his seniors and looks out for his juniors. He is known for his tendency to pick fights with other players who disrespect Karasuno, which results in him being disciplined by Daichi or Sugawara. He harbors (seemingly unrequited) feelings for the team's manager, Kiyoko Shimizu.

The physically strongest member of the team, he is considered the "ace" of the volleyball team. Though mild-mannered and timid, his stature, strength, and long hair make him appear older and more intimidating than he is, leading players from other teams to speculate that he is in fact a grown man who has been held back.

                        Kei Tsukishima (月島 蛍, Tsukishima Kei) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and the volleyball team's tallest player. A middle blocker, he is known for his calm and clever blocking style in which he quickly analyzes and reacts to opponents' plays. His condescending attitude and tendency to make snide remarks puts him at odds with both his own teammates (particularly Kageyama and Hinata) as well as members of opposing teams. Despite being a key member of Karasuno's defense, Tsukishima struggles due to his lack of devotion to the sport and inability to understand why others are so invested. His closest friend is fellow first-year Tadashi Yamaguchi, who refers to him by the nickname "Tsukki."

                        Tadashi Yamaguchi (山口 忠, Yamaguchi Tadashi) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. The only first-year on the team not to make the starting lineup, Yamaguchi serves as a backup middle blocker as well as a serving specialist due to his adoption of the float serve technique. Though generally friendly and good-mannered, he sometimes engages in teasing his teammates due to his close friendship with Kei Tsukishima. Yamaguchi appears to idolize Tsukishima, which stems from Tsukishima scaring off bullies when they were children. A running gag in the series involves Yamaguchi defending or complimenting Tsukishima, Tsukishima telling him to shut up, and Yamaguchi apologizing.
